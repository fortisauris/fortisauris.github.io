<h1>How to crack passwords</h1>
<p>At this moment milions of computers communicating each other in connected network like Internet, Local Networks(LANS). Every of them has more than one identity to protect. In the beginning they exchanged passwords in plaintext, sometimes wasn't password protection used by Users and Admins. Computer infrastructure wa far more open to hackers. Passwords are now exchanged between computers in form of hash strings.

	Hash string is something like unique fingerprint of password or data. Those passwords hashes are stored in computer and sometimes you could find them in network traffic.

	To crack password you must found hashed word equals hashed password. There are several methods to crack a password:
	<sl>
		<li>Bruteforce Method
    	Primitive Bruteforce Cracking software like Nutcracker is Part of SPLaucher.</li>

		<li>Use professional password cracking software as:
		John The Ripper(Linux) or OCL Hashcat </li>

		<li>Use Rainbow tables
		Database already used and cracked passwords.</li>
	</sl>

	More complicated password is is more less probable to crack him. Using special characters and length of password is recommended. Change it periodically.
