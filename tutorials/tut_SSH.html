<h1>Connect remote computer via ssh</h1>
<p>Simple way to connect to remote computer is using ssh.
To check if your Linux computer  has ssh already installed write to terminal prompt:<br></p>
<code>ssh</code>
<p>It should return some kind of help or usage instructions. If not,  you should install ssh via your packet manager *</p>
<p><br>For example Raspberry Pi with Raspbian Linux: </p>
<p><code>sudo apt-get install ssh</code><br>
</p>

<p>Basic usage of ssh is simple:<br>
<code>ssh username@hostname</code><br>

    username: name of user (pi, root, dorian_grey etc.) to log in.
    hostname: domain or IP address (google.com or ipv4 address like 192.168.0.1 etc.)<br></p>
<p>In first connection computers exchange their keys so you will be asked if you want to save key of remote computer
    to list of known hosts. If you enter yes computers remember their keys and you will be not asked anymore.<br>
After this ssh should start encrypted tunnel to remote computer and you could use linux terminal from other computer.<br>

	Remote computer asks to enter a password. 
	
for more informations about ssh and documentation enter:</p>
	<code>man ssh</code> 
	<p>to Linux or Windows terminal.</p>
	
	<p>* Packet Manager is computer program that manage installed packets of software. It depends what distro of Linux you use.</p>
